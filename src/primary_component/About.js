      "My name is Edvania. I'm originally from Brazil and am a mother of 2 kids, and I'm 41 years old. Eight years ago, I was going through a severe depression during the dark time. I figured that I would change my life completely, so I decided to move to America with my two kids. I lived with my sister for a short period in Chicago, and I decided to go to the gym with her. I took Yoga classes, and I fell in love. After a couple of months, I didn't feel depressed anymore. I started eating healthy food and giving up my bad habits, and I began to see all the results of caring for myself, which made me want to change even more. ",
    paraTwo:
      "Little by little, I included good habits in my routine, and for the first time in my life, I started to believe in myself. Finally, I got cured of the depression that almost took my life away. I tried suicide. Thank God it didn't succeed. After a couple of months, I married and had a great relationship, but I divorced five years later. I struggled, but at the time, my mindset was strong, and I survived the hard time I did give up on my fitness journey. I decided to go even further to take a class and become a Personal Trainer in San Diego.",
