                At RCotterill PT, I want to help men and women that have felt
                like they've been spinning their wheels with their fitness and
                health. I grasp that different diets can seem attractive and
                trying various solutions to find the style of eating that's
                right for you seems essential - but it can also slow your
                progress down while you are spending time on trial and error.
